"A grid is a structure of intersecting lines or bars. It is used as a guide to divide and organize a space. Usually, a grid is two-dimensional, and the lines are evenly spaced, intersecting at right angles.

Grids are useful for organizing and ordering information. When information is organized in a grid structure, any unit of information is located by specifying two of the intersecting lines."
